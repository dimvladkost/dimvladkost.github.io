This can be a lonely and isolating process, but it can be much easier if you are prepared. Here, I have tried to compile resources into various sections that are relative cohesive. I am not posting any of the stuff I wrote for my own applications, but if you want to see them, you can contact me.\nUseful Links\nApplication package\nInterviewing\nNegotiating\nRandom advice\nUseful Links Obviously, I am not the first person to have thought of such a thing, so here are some links to sites I used when I was applying:\n1. The best academic job advice aggregator site around This has lots of resources from lots of different people. I generally found the links to ‘Physioprof’ aka Drugmonkey to be quite good.\n2. Comprehensive document on getting a job This is a document written by Erik Lee Snapp, who is now Director of Student and Postdoctoral Programs at Janelia. It is really useful because it has several real examples of each elemnt of your application package. His page on the Janelia website also has a bunch of useful links.\n3. Blog post describing how to navigate the UK’s ‘Fellowship’ academic route. The process in the UK tends to take 2 forms: you either apply for a Lectureship, where you have a lot of teaching responsibilities but your salary is guaranteed from the beginning, or you apply to be hosted by a Univeristy for a Fellowship. This fellowship essentially acts as your startup and buys you out of having to teach for the first ~5 years of your appointment. Most funders now require Universities to offer their Fellows a permanent position at the end of the fellowship.\n4. Where to look for job advertisements The big journal websites - Cell, Nature, and Science - have job posting aggregators, which are fairly redundant with one another. It is useful to check on these regularly (e.g. twice a week) in the late summer/early fall as jobs are being posted. I kept a google sheet with all the adverts, deadlines, and requirements, so that I could check things off as I applied.\nThe other best place is probably twitter, especially if you can find someone to follow who keeps an annotated list for your field.\n5. Postdoc seminar series Lots of places run seminar series specifically for postdocs that you can use to practice giving job talks. Look for these in your field. Below, I provide a list of neuro-centric links that are largely based on a twitter thread I came across and the ensuing replies. There are lots of these seminars, they invariably have some cringy neuro-acronym, and everyone I know who has done one raves about how they are really good practice. The best time to do these if you want to use them as practice is the year before you will apply, since many of them run in the spring (at the same time that you will hopefully be giving your actual job talks).\nList of Neuro-centric seminar series in the US and Europe: Brown BrainExpo - deadline 29 July, 2022\nHarvard INCEPT\nMax Planck Florida NeuroMEETS - deadline 10 August, 2022\nMax Planck Frankfurt mEPSCs\nMount Sinai MSNseminars\nNYU SPiNES - deadline 9 September, 2022\nRochester NeuroYES\nSainsbury Wellcome Centre ENSS - deadline 10 August, 2022\nSyracuse Early Career Research Seminar Series - seemingly no specific deadline\nUChicago Rising Stars in Neuroscience\nUTSW SiNaPS\nVanderbilt GPCR\nWorld Wide NeuRise\nYale SYNAPSES\nBack to top Application package Your application package will consist of several items that you will mostly be able to reuse with personalization for each institution. This site has a pretty good breakdown of what you need.\n1. Cover letter It is probably best to try to fit this on a single page. The layout for this is pretty standard: (1) Opening paragraph describing (a) the job you are applying for and (b) what you plan to work on. Set the tone early and make sure your one sentence summary is compelling. (2) Background - \u0026#39;As a postdoc in prestigious institution X with renowned Professor Y, I discovered Z...Prior to this, I was a PhD student with...\u0026#39; (3) Future plan - \u0026#39;As an independent investigator, I will...\u0026#34; (4) Departmental Fit - \u0026#39;Your world-renowned Department would be the ideal place for me to forge an independent career path. My scientific program would complement the ongoing work and generate collaborative opportunities...\u0026#39; (5) Community - \u0026#39;Critical to my motivation for become a group leader is my desire to teach and mentor the next generation of young sceintists. I have served as a teaching fellow in contexts A and B and mentored a number of students in contexts C and D. (6) References - \u0026#39;Professors Belichick, Brady, and Vinatieri will submit letters on my behalf. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.\u0026#39; *If you are short on space, you can probably leave off stuff about the referees.

To make this link explicit, we have performed two-photon calcium imaging experiments of Purkinje cell dendrites and molecular layer interneurons in awake mice. With these recordings, we find that single interneurons suppress activity in individual dendritic branches of Purkinje cells in vivo, validating a key feature of the model. Thus, our theoretical and experimental results draw a specific link between learning in DGNs and the functional architecture of the cerebellum. The generality of the DGN architecture should also allow this algorithm to be implemented in a range of networks in the mammalian brain, including the neocortex.\nThis project is a collaboration with researchers at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL and Google DeepMind.\n","date":1655337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655337600,"objectID":"49584c5919c7fba4c66503b7c59f06a0","permalink":"https://dimvladkost.github.io/project/dgn/","publishdate":"2022-06-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dgn/","section":"project","summary":"In this project, we introduce a powerful new biologically plausible machine learning algorithm: the Dendritic Gated Network (DGN), a variant of the Gated Linear Network.

This idea has received renewed support with the recent discovery that signals associated with reward can be observed in the cerebellar circuitry, particularly in goal-directed learning tasks involving an interplay between the cerebellar cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. Remarkably, a wide range of reward contingencies—including reward expectation, delivery, size, and omission—can be encoded by specific circuit elements in a manner that reflects the microzonal organization of the cerebellar cortex. The facts that reward signals have been observed in both the mossy fiber and climbing fiber input pathways to the cerebellar cortex and that their convergence may trigger plasticity in Purkinje cells suggest that these interactions may be crucial for the role of the cerebellar cortex in learned behavior. These findings strengthen the emerging consensus that the cerebellum plays a pivotal role in shaping cognitive processing and suggest that the cerebellum may combine both supervised learning and reinforcement learning to optimize goal-directed action. We make specific predictions about how cerebellar circuits can work in concert with the basal ganglia to guide different stages of learning.","tags":["Cerebellar computation"],"title":"Reward signals in the cerebellum: Origins, targets, and functional implications","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Pastries are also a human right. - Me\nPastries Best Pain au chocolat: Little Bread Pedlar - pastries are available at Monmouth Coffee\nBest pastry (non-Pain au chocolat): Kouign amann from Miel Bakery\nBest donut: Lemon curd filled from St. John Bakery\nBest coffee/brunch Monmouth coffee - fancy coffee that’s not pretentious\nJuliet’s Quality Food - brunch!\nBest sub Dom’s subs Best Bulgarian store Balkanika - also happens to be across the road from Juliet’s ","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"a29f78fcc8a07558f7c9fe06eef0b704","permalink":"https://dimvladkost.github.io/resource/delicious_london/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/delicious_london/","section":"resource","summary":"Pastries are also a human right. - Me","tags":[],"title":"Delicious things in London","type":"resource"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The interplay between Purkinje cells and nuclear cells has been a topic of debate in the cerebellar field for decades.

It is unclear, however, how the brain is able to determine which synapses should change, and by how much. This uncertainty stands in sharp contrast to deep learning, where changes in weights are explicitly engineered to optimize performance. However, the main tool for doing that, backpropagation, is not biologically plausible, and networks trained with this rule tend to forget old tasks when learning new ones. Here we introduce the Dendritic Gated Network (DGN), a variant of the Gated Linear Network [1, 2], which offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. DGNs combine dendritic “gating” (whereby interneurons target dendrites to shape neuronal response) with local learning rules to yield provably efficient performance. They are significantly more data efficient than conventional artificial networks and are highly resistant to forgetting, and we show that they perform well on a variety of tasks, in some cases better than backpropagation. The DGN bears similarities to the cerebellum, where there is evidence for shaping of Purkinje cell responses by interneurons. It also makes several experimental predictions, one of which we validate with in vivo cerebellar imaging of mice performing a motor task.","tags":["Cerebellar computation","Biologically plausible learning"],"title":"A rapid and efficient learning rule for biological neural circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimitar Kostadinov","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

We probed the role of climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells in generating and evaluating predictions about associations between motor actions, sensory stimuli and reward. We trained mice to perform a visuomotor integration task to receive a reward and interleaved cued and random rewards between task trials. Using two-photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels probe recordings of Purkinje cell activity, we show that climbing fibers signal reward expectation, delivery and omission. These signals map onto cerebellar microzones, with reward delivery activating some microzones and suppressing others, and with reward omission activating both reward-activated and reward-suppressed microzones. Moreover, responses to predictable rewards are progressively suppressed during learning. Our findings elucidate a specific input pathway for cerebellar contributions to reward signaling and provide a mechanistic link between cerebellar activity and the creation and evaluation of predictions.","tags":["Cerebellar computation"],"title":"Predictive and reactive reward signals conveyed by climbing fiber inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimitar Kostadinov","Alexandre Mathy","Beverley A Clark"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552694400,"objectID":"5dd87a2a154b903b14cdf68f38dc4b3e","permalink":"https://dimvladkost.github.io/publication/kostadinov2019_chapter/","publishdate":"2019-03-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kostadinov2019_chapter/","section":"publication","summary":"The inferior olive gives rise to the climbing fiber input to cerebellar Purkinje cells and is therefore the source of one of the most powerful synapses in the brain, generating the large burst of Purkinje cell activity referred to as the complex spike. The timing of complex spikes plays a key role in theories of cerebellar function and the determinants of the temporal output structure of neurons of the inferior olive are thus of critical importance. Olivary neurons display spontaneous subthreshold oscillations (STOs) that are generated by the interplay of intrinsic voltage- and calcium-gated conductances and electrotonic coupling between groups of neurons that consequently oscillate in synchrony. Olivary action potentials are also complex, consisting of an initial spike followed by a plateau potential that drives a burst of axonal action potentials. The STOs can influence the timing of spike output and the number of spikes in the burst, implicating them in important downstream effects in the cerebellar cortex, such as complex spike timing, synchrony, and synaptic plasticity. STOs and the coupling between olivary neurons can be modified by extrinsic input, a key candidate being the afferent inhibitory connections forming the descending limb of the olivocerebellar loop. This may result in an olivary network with dynamic properties, which has led to theories of the olivocerebellar system as a generator of spatiotemporal patterns of firing. This chapter discusses evidence for these and competing models, as well as their implications for the production of motor rhythms.","tags":["Cerebellar computation"],"title":"Dynamics of the Inferior Olive Oscillator and Cerebellar Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

Pcdh isoforms from different clusters are combinatorially expressed in neurons. They form multimers that interact homophilically and mediate a variety of developmental processes, including neuronal survival, synaptic maintenance, axonal tiling, and dendritic self-avoidance. Most studies have analyzed clusters individually. Here, we assessed functional interactions between Pcdha and Pcdhg clusters. To circumvent neonatal lethality associated with deletion of Pcdhgs, we used Crispr-Cas9 genome editing in mice to combine a constitutive Pcdha mutant allele with a conditional Pcdhg allele. We analyzed roles of Pcdhas and Pcdhgs in the retina and cerebellum from mice (both sexes) lacking one or both clusters. In retina, Pcdhgs are essential for survival of inner retinal neurons and dendritic self-avoidance of starburst amacrine cells, whereas Pcdhas are dispensable for both processes. Deletion of both Pcdha and Pcdhg clusters led to far more dramatic defects in survival and self-avoidance than Pcdhg deletion alone. Comparisons of an allelic series of mutants support the conclusion that Pcdhas and Pcdhgs function together in a dose-dependent and cell-type-specific manner to provide a critical threshold of Pcdh activity. In the cerebellum, Pcdhas and Pcdhgs also cooperate to mediate self-avoidance of Purkinje cell dendrites, with modest but significant defects in either single mutant and dramatic defects in the double mutant. Together, our results demonstrate complex patterns of redundancy between Pcdh clusters and the importance of Pcdh cluster diversity in postnatal CNS development.","tags":["Dendritic self-avoidance","PhD"],"title":"Combinatorial effects of alpha-and gamma-protocadherins on neuronal survival and dendritic self-avoidance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi-Rong Peng","Nicholas M Tran","Arjun Krishnaswamy","Dimitar Kostadinov","Emily M Martersteck","Joshua R Sanes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502841600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502841600,"objectID":"a2f9bd3b27d440bf745ceef2c2823145","permalink":"https://dimvladkost.github.io/publication/peng2017/","publishdate":"2017-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peng2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The size and shape of dendritic arbors are prime determinants of neuronal connectivity and function. We asked how ON-OFF direction-selective ganglion cells (ooDSGCs) in mouse retina acquire their bistratified dendrites, in which responses to light onset and light offset are segregated to distinct strata. We found that the transcriptional regulator Satb1 is selectively expressed by ooDSGCs. In Satb1 mutant mice, ooDSGC dendrites lack ON arbors, and the cells selectively lose ON responses. Satb1 regulates expression of a homophilic adhesion molecule, Contactin 5 (*Cntn5*). Both Cntn5 and its co-receptor Caspr4 are expressed not only by ooDSGCs, but also by interneurons that form a scaffold on which ooDSGC ON dendrites fasciculate. Removing Cntn5 from either ooDSGCs or interneurons partially phenocopies Satb1 mutants, demonstrating that Satb1-dependent Cntn5 expression in ooDSGCs leads to branch-specific homophilic interactions with interneurons.

In some cases, these neurites interact with those of neighboring neurons, a phenomenon called self/non-self discrimination. The functional roles of these processes remain unknown. In this study, we used retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs), critical components of a direction-selective circuit, to address this issue. In SACs, both processes are mediated by the gamma-protocadherins (Pcdhgs), a family of 22 recognition molecules. We manipulated Pcdhg expression in SACs and recorded from them and their targets, direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). SACs form autapses when self-avoidance is disrupted and fail to form connections with other SACs when self/non-self discrimination is perturbed. Pcdhgs are also required to prune connections between closely spaced SACs. These alterations degrade the direction selectivity of DSGCs. Thus, self-avoidance, self/non-self discrimination, and synapse elimination are essential for proper function of a circuit that computes directional motion.","tags":["Dendritic self-avoidance"],"title":"Protocadherin-dependent dendritic self-avoidance regulates neural connectivity and circuit function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimitar Kostadinov"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1431475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1431475200,"objectID":"eae397ab3eb2e76b3c802be4d43d256f","permalink":"https://dimvladkost.github.io/publication/kostadinov2015_thesis/","publishdate":"2015-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kostadinov2015_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Dendritic and axonal arbors of many neuronal types exhibit self-avoidance, a phenomenon in which branches repel each other. This process ensures that individual neurons cover all parts of their territory uniformly. Some neurons that self-avoid overlap with neighbors of the same type, suggesting that nominally identical neurons are immune to each other’s repellent forces, a phenomenon called self/non-self discrimination. Here, I describe the roles of the 22 clustered gamma-Protocadherin (Pcdhg) recognition molecules in dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination of mammalian neurons, and the roles of these phenomena in a retinal circuit. First, I present studies showing that Pcdhgs are necessary for dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination of retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Using loss and gain of function experiments, we showed that no single Pcdhg isoform is necessary and any Pcdhg isoform is sufficient to mediate self-avoidance. However, forcing neighboring SACs to express a single Pcdhg decreases their overlap. Thus, Pcdhg diversity is necessary for SACs to avoid their own dendrites, but interact with their neighbors (self/non-self discrimination). Second, I describe the roles of self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination in the function of a retinal direction-selective circuit that depends on SACs. Dendrites of SACs compute directional motion and endow classes of retinal ganglion cells with this property by inhibiting them asymmetrically during visual motion. In addition, SACs form inhibitory synapses in order to sharpen each other’s direction-selectivity. I present findings that elucidate the roles self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination in the function of this direction-selective circuit: (1) In the absence of self-avoidance, SACs form synapses with their own dendrites. (2) In the absence of self/non-self discrimination, SACs form few synapses with each other, (3) Loss of either self-avoidance or self/non-self discrimination degrades directional responses of ganglion cells. Lastly, I describe initial efforts to understand the combinatorial roles of all clustered Pcdh family members, which also include 14 alpha- and 22 beta-Protocadherins (Pcdhas and Pcdhbs, respectively). We used CRISPR-mediated genome engineering to generate Pcdha/Pcdhg double mutants. Initial analysis shows that their defects are more striking than those of either Pcdha or Pcdhg mutants, suggesting redundancy between these two subclusters.","tags":["Dendritic self-avoidance","Thesis"],"title":"Mechanism and function of dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination in the mammalian nervous system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julie L Lefebvre","Dimitar Kostadinov","Weisheng V Chen","Tom Maniatis","Joshua R Sanes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1345680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1345680000,"objectID":"55e0595c3d16b818e6b510f34e118922","permalink":"https://dimvladkost.github.io/publication/lefebvre2012/","publishdate":"2012-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lefebvre2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Dendritic arborizations of many neurons are patterned by a process called self-avoidance, in which branches arising from a single neuron repel each other. By minimizing gaps and overlaps within the arborization, self-avoidance facilitates complete coverage of a neuron’s territory by its neurites. Remarkably, some neurons that display self-avoidance interact freely with other neurons of the same subtype, implying that they discriminate self from non-self. Here we demonstrate roles for the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) in dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. The *Pcdh* locus encodes 58 related cadherin-like transmembrane proteins, at least some of which exhibit isoform-specific homophilic adhesion in heterologous cells and are expressed stochastically and combinatorially in single neurons. Deletion of all 22 *Pcdh* genes in the mouse γ-subcluster (*Pcdhg* genes) disrupts self-avoidance of dendrites in retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Further genetic analysis of SACs showed that Pcdhg proteins act cell-autonomously during development, and that replacement of the 22 Pcdhg proteins with a single isoform restores self-avoidance. Moreover, expression of the same single isoform in all SACs decreases interactions among dendrites of neighbouring SACs (heteroneuronal interactions). These results suggest that homophilic Pcdhg interactions between sibling neurites (isoneuronal interactions) generate a repulsive signal that leads to self-avoidance. In this model, heteroneuronal interactions are normally permitted because dendrites seldom encounter a matched set of Pcdhg proteins unless they emanate from the same soma. In many respects, our results mirror those reported for *Dscam1 (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule)* in *Drosophila*: this complex gene encodes thousands of recognition molecules that exhibit stochastic expression and isoform-specific interactions, and mediate both self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. Thus, although insect Dscam and vertebrate Pcdh proteins share no sequence homology, they seem to underlie similar strategies for endowing neurons with distinct molecular identities and patterning their arborizations.","tags":["Dendritic self-avoidance","PhD"],"title":"Protocadherins mediate dendritic self-avoidance in the mammalian nervous system","type":"publication"}]
